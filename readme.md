When I say "data", I'm talking about tables.

<!-- 
The world is complicated; we need to simplify it in
order to understand it. Representing the world as
tabular data is one way of doing that.

<!--
Sometimes the data are still too complicated, so we
simplify these data further with statistics.

We simplify the data enough that we can understand it,
then we convert our data back into other things, like
papers and graphs.

(Remember, "data" are tables.)

Some things got cheap faster than other things did.

# World -> Data

<!--
Now it's super cheap to collect data, sometimes.
We collect the data practically for free by measuring things that are already happening.
We don't worry too much about designing a research plan. We wind up with
very large, often complete, historical data.
Here are some convenient/inexpensive data collection approaches.

Sensors

Captricity

Websites, social media

# Data -> Data

<!--
We decided to collect more data because it was cheap.
The resulting data are far more complicated than the data
coming out of questionnaires, so we need to do more statistics
on them.
